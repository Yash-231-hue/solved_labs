OverTheWire Bandit - Concepts Breakdown
======================================

BEGINNER (Levels 0–9)
---------------------
- Filesystem navigation: ls, cd, pwd
- File viewing: cat, head, tail, less
- Hidden files & special filenames: spaces, '-' as filename
- File permissions: ls -l basics
- Basic searching: find, grep
- Input/output redirection: >, <, |, >>
- Working with simple passwords in files

INTERMEDIATE (Levels 10–20)
---------------------------
- Data extraction: strings, xxd, cut, sort, uniq
- File identification: file command (binary vs text)
- Compression & archiving: tar, gzip, bzip2, xz
- Encoding & decoding: Base64, ROT13, hex
- Network basics: nc (netcat), telnet, openssl s_client
- SSH key authentication: ssh -i private keys
- Environment variables: secrets in env

ADVANCED (Levels 21–34)
-----------------------
- Cron jobs: analyzing scheduled tasks for secrets
- Process inspection: ps, checking running processes
- Setuid binaries: exploiting executables with elevated privileges
- Restricted shells: escape techniques (cat, more, vi, ssh -t)
- Scripting attacks: bash loops, automation for brute force
- Port knocking / tunneling concepts
- Git exploitation: git log, git show, recovering deleted secrets
- Automation & scripting: pipes and one-liners
- Advanced networking: chained services, port redirections
- Privilege escalation mindset: exploiting misconfigurations, weak cron, bad SSH configs

Summary:
Beginner = Linux basics
Intermediate = File formats, compression, networking, encoding
Advanced = System interaction, restricted shells, privilege escalation
